In this paper, we consider a UAV trajectory planning problem with probabilistic geo-fence, building on the chance-constrained optimization approach. In the considered problem, randomness of the model, such as the uncertain boundaries of geo-fences, is incorporated in the formulation. By solving the formulated chance-constrained optimization with a novel sampling based solution method, the optimal UAV trajectory is achieved while limiting the probability of collision with geo-fences to a prefixed threshold. Furthermore, to obtain a totally collision-free trajectory, i.e., avoiding the collision not only at the discrete time-steps but also red within the entire time horizon, we build on the idea of an iterative scheme. That is, to iterate the solving of the chance-constrained optimization until the collision with probabilistic geo-fence is avoided at any time within the time horizon. At last, we validate the effectiveness of our method via numerical simulations.","tags":[],"title":"UAV Trajectory Planning with Probabilistic Geo-Fence via Iterative Chance-Constrained Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

With this increased interest, it is imperative that these UAVs are able to operate in shared airspace for enhanced efficiency. Multi-UAV systems are inherently safety-critical systems, which means that safety guarantees must be made to ensure no undesirable configurations, such as collisions, occur. This paper proposes a decentralized method based on a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to generate collision-free 3D trajectories for multiple UAVs operating in a shared airspace. This method exploits the dynamical properties of multi-phase fluids flowing through a porous medium by modeling the porosity values as a function of the risk of collision. To highlight the feasibility for on-board implementation, we propose propose a machine learning technique for obtaining computationally efficient solutions of the PDE describing flow movements in porous medium. This method has been compared via a simulation study to two other path planning strategies, centralized and sequential planning, and the advantages of this method are presented. Furthermore, results from an experiment using three UAVs have been presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to real-world implementation.","tags":["\"Decentralized control\"","\"Large scale optimization\"","\"Partial Differential Equation (PDE) method\"","\"Trajectory planning\"","\"Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs)\""],"title":"Towards a PDE-based large-scale decentralized solution for path planning of UAVs in shared airspace","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eloy Garcia","David W Casbeer","Meir Pachter"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611007058,"objectID":"02b174ad1b7838991eaeb63fda2c77d6","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/garcia-optimal-reachavoid-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-18T21:57:38.090267Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-optimal-reachavoid-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"A multi-player reach-avoid differential game with autonomous aerial robots in the three dimensional space is studied.

To aid the UAV, some roads in the network are instrumented with unattended ground sensors (UGSs) that detect the target‚Äôs motion and record the time it passes by the UGS. When the UAV flies over an UGS location, this time stamped information, if available, is communicated to it. At time 0, the target enters the road network and selects a path leading to one of the exit nodes. The UAV also arrives at the same entry UGS after some delay and is thus informed about the presence of the target in the network. The UAV has no on-board sensing capability and so, capture entails the UAV and target being colocated at an UGS location. If this happens, the UGS is triggered and this information is instantaneously relayed to the UAV, thereby enabling capture. On the other hand, if the target reaches an exit node without being captured, he is deemed to have escaped. We transform the road network, which is restricted to a directed acyclic graph, into a time tree whose node is a tuple comprising the UGS location and evader arrival time at that location. For a given initial delay, we present a recursive forward search method that computes the minimum capture time UAV pursuit policy, under worst-case target action. The recursion scales poorly in the problem parameters, i.e., number of nodes in the time tree and number of evader paths. We present a novel branch and bound technique and a pre-processing step that is experimentally shown to reduce the computational burden by at least two orders of magnitude. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed pruning methods, which result in no loss in optimality, on a realistic example road network.","tags":[],"title":"Graph search of a moving ground target by a UAV aided by ground sensors with local information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eloy Garcia","David W Casbeer","Meir Pachter"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611007057,"objectID":"ade44d7c0aad3571b6fa00111a400842","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/garcia-optimaldg-circularregion-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-18T21:57:37.764214Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-optimaldg-circularregion-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"A two-player differential game is considered where a spy infiltrates the region of interest and a defender pursues and tries to capture the spy before it leaves such region.

We use the minimum time stochastic optimal control to navigate each UAV towards the inspection of each ground vehicle. Based on this control, we formulate assignments of ground vehicles to be inspected by UAVs as an optimization problem to inspect all ground vehicles in the minimum expected time. Accounting for ground vehicle uncertain trajectories, we update the optimal assignment by a Markov inequality rule. The rule prevents the possibility of indefinite updating of assignments without finishing the inspection of all vehicles.

The argument is twofold: cases where the saddle-point condition is violated and cases where the strategy profiles are not time consistent (subgame perfect). The issue of capturability is explored, and sufficient conditions for guaranteed capture are provided. A new pursuit policy is proposed which guarantees capture while also providing an upper bound for capture time. The evader policy corresponding to the global Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to provide a lower bound for capture time.

Upon reaching a target, the bomber may fire a weapon at it. If the target survives the direct fire, it can either return fire or choose to hold fire (play dead).

After the current engagement, the bomber, if still alive, can either re‚Äêengage the same target or move on to the next target in the sequence. The bomber seeks to maximize the expected cumulative damage it can inflict on the targets. We solve the perfect and partial information problems, where a target always fires back and sometimes fires back respectively using stochastic dynamic programming. The perfect information scenario yields an appealing threshold based bombing policy. Indeed, the marginal future reward is the threshold at which the control policy switches and furthermore, the threshold is monotonic decreasing with the number of weapons left with the bomber and monotonic nondecreasing with the number of targets left in the mission. For the partial information scenario, we show via a counterexample that the marginal future reward is not the threshold at which the control switches. In light of the negative result, we provide an appealing threshold based heuristic instead. Finally, we address the partial information game, where the target can choose to fire back and establish the Nash equilibrium strategies for a representative two target scenario.","tags":[],"title":"A sequential partial information bomber-defender shooting problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The combination of a small UAV and a ground vehicle is an ideal platform for such missions, since small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats that would be problematic for the ground vehicle alone. This paper addresses the coordinated routing problem involving these two vehicles and presents an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution for this problem, fast heuristics to obtain good feasible solutions, and also a transformation method to transform any instance of this cooperative vehicle routing problem to an instance of the one-in-a-set traveling salesman problem.","tags":["\"aerospace communication\"","\"air-ground vehicle team-exact algorithm\"","\"autonomous aerial vehicles\"","\"Base stations\"","\"Branch-and-cut\"","\"branch-and-cut algorithm\"","\"collision avoidance\"","\"communication constraints\"","\"cooperative routing\"","\"cooperative vehicle routing\"","\"coordinated routing problem\"","\"Heuristic algorithms\"","\"heuristics\"","\"integer programming\"","\"Land vehicles\"","\"linear programming\"","\"mixed-integer linear program\"","\"obstacle avoidance\"","\"path planning\"","\"reconnaissance mission\"","\"Routing\"","\"Surveillance\"","\"transformation method\"","\"transforms\"","\"travelling salesman problems\"","\"UAV\"","\"unmanned aerial vehicle\"","\"Unmanned aerial vehicles\"","\"unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\"","\"vehicle routing\"","\"Vehicle routing\"","\"vehicle routing problem\""],"title":"Cooperative Routing for an Air‚ÄìGround Vehicle Team‚ÄîExact Algorithm, Transformation Method, and Heuristics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

The scalable strategy is based on a stochastic optimal control problem formulation of safe navigation in the presence of a single vehicle, denoted as the one-on-one vehicle problem. It is shown that safe navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles can be solved exactly as an auxiliary Markov decision problem.

An Attacker missile is pursuing a Target aircraft. The Target aircraft is aided by a Defender missile launched by, say, the wingman, to intercept the Attacker before it reaches the Target aircraft. Thus, a team is formed by the Target and the Defender which cooperate to maximize the separation between the Target aircraft and the point where the Attacker missile is intercepted by the Defender missile, while at the same time the Attacker tries to minimize said distance. A long-range Beyond Visual Range engagement which is in line with current CONcepts of OPeration is envisaged, and it is therefore assumed that the players have simple motion kinematics √° la Isaacs. Also, the speed of the Attacker is equal to the speed of the Defender and the latter is interested in point capture. It is also assumed that at all time the Attacker is aware of the Defender‚Äôs position, i.e., it is a perfect information game. The analytic/closed-form solution of the target defense pursuit-evasion differential game delineates the state space region where the Attacker can reach the Target without being intercepted by the Defender, thus disposing of the Game of Kind. The target defense Game of Degree is played in the remaining state space. The analytic solution of the Game of Degree yields the agents‚Äô optimal state feedback strategies, that is, the instantaneous heading angles for the Target and the Defender team to maximize the terminal separation between Target and Attacker at the instant of interception of the Attacker by the Defender, and also the instantaneous optimal heading for the Attacker to minimize said separation. Their calculation hinges on the real-time solution of a quartic equation. In this paper we contribute to the solution of a differential game with three states‚Äîan additional example to the, admittedly small, repertoire of pursuit-evasion differential games in 3-D which can be solved in closed form.","tags":[],"title":"Toward a Solution of the Active Target Defense Differential Game","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

The Target UAV cooperates with up to two Defender missiles which are launched in order to intercept the Attacker before the latter reaches the Target. This is a scenario with important military applications where each one of the agents is an autonomous air vehicle. Each agent plans and corrects its course of action in order to defeat an opposing force while simultaneously optimizing an operational relevant cost/payoff performance measure. The Target and the Defenders cooperate to form a team against the Attacker. The results in this paper build on the solution of a three agent differential game, where the three players are the Target, the Attacker, and one Defender; in this paper, the benefits of firing a second Defender are considered. Indeed, launching two interceptor missiles is a standard procedure by providing redundant backup. Building on the solution of the one-Defender problem, it is possible to address a seemingly intractable problem, where the Target needs to decide which Defender(s) to cooperate with, in addition to obtaining the optimal headings of every player in the game. Given the initial positions of the players, we solve the problem of determining if a second Defender improves the Target/Defender(s) payoff and provide the optimal strategies for each of the agents involved. Finally, we address the game of kind (for the case of one Defender) which provides the safety regions to determine which side will win based on the initial state. These safety regions provides the Target‚Äôs area of vulnerability, and using these results, we describe the reduction to the Target‚Äôs vulnerability area brought by an additional Defender.","tags":[],"title":"The Target Differential Game with Two Defenders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Satyanarayana G.

A third agent is a defender missile which is fired by the Target's wingman. The defender's mission is to intercept the attacker in time to enable a successful target evasion and its survival. The problem is naturally posed as a zero-sum DG. The target and the defender form a team; their objective is to determine a cooperative strategy to maximise the terminal separation between the target aircraft and the point where the Attacker missile is intercepted by the Defender missile. The Attacker is the opposition and its task is to devise its own strategy to minimise the same terminal distance. The solution of the ATDDG provides the instantaneous optimal heading angles for each agent playing the game in order to achieve their objectives. Most importantly, the agents' strategies are state feedback laws. The assumption of simple motion dynamics of the agents yields their optimal headings which is adequate in a beyond visual range engagement, as it is currently envisioned to be the pertinent operational scenario.","tags":["\"active target defence differential game\"","\"aerospace control\"","\"agent strategies\"","\"aircraft control\"","\"ATDDG\"","\"attacker missile\"","\"cooperative strategy\"","\"defender missile\"","\"defender mission\"","\"differential games\"","\"instantaneous optimal heading angles\"","\"missile control\"","\"motion dynamics\"","\"optimal headings\"","\"pertinent operational headings\"","\"state feedback laws\"","\"target wingman\"","\"terminal distance minimisation\"","\"terminal separation maximisation\"","\"visual range engagement\"","\"zero-sum DG\""],"title":"Active target defence differential game: fast defender case","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Wang","Eloy Garcia","David Casbeer","Fumin Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611329636,"objectID":"dc14169b3f7332131549b47bec5bb188","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/wang-cooperative-2017/","publishdate":"2021-01-22T15:33:56.008713Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-cooperative-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Cooperative control of multi-agent systems: Theory and applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dejan Milutinoviƒá","David Casbeer","Yongcan Cao","Derek Kingston"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611007057,"objectID":"f742ad14ba55e6201d341f6d01c63832","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/milutinovic-range-based-circumnavigation-2017/","publishdate":"2021-01-18T21:57:37.273849Z","relpermalink":"/publication/milutinovic-range-based-circumnavigation-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Coordinate frame free Dubins vehicle circumnavigation using only range-based measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eloy Garcia","David Casbeer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611329636,"objectID":"c1b82704451c302e96b333a41027e97c","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/garcia-coordinated-2017/","publishdate":"2021-01-22T15:33:56.180364Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-coordinated-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Coordinated Threat Assignments and Mission Management of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongcan Cao","David Casbeer","Eloy Garcia","Corey Schumacher"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611329636,"objectID":"27a618669d9a380b7c4e4d4ea9065348","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/cao-distributed-2017/","publishdate":"2021-01-22T15:33:56.514981Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cao-distributed-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Distributed multi-agent coordination with uncertain interactions: A probabilistic perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

The UAV has no visibility of the intruder and can obtain the information only about the intruder's location from unattended ground sensors (UGSs) preinstalled on the road network. An UGS detects a passing intruder and records the time of passage. It can also upload the time-stamped information to the UAV directly overhead. This paper focuses on finding the optimal sequence of UGSs for the UAV to visit and the corresponding waiting time around each UGS to achieve isolation for the two variants of the IIP. This task is challenging due to the continuous movement of the intruder along the road network and the partial information scenario. To address these challenges, we propose an unfolding strategy to transform the road network to a decision tree, which describes all possible routes that the intruder may select to follow. Based on the decision tree, the optimal solution to the isolation problem is computed via dynamic programming (DP). To alleviate the computational complexity of DP, an UGS ranking scheme is proposed. Numerical implementations based on a real road network are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach.","tags":["\"aerospace control\"","\"autonomous aerial vehicles\"","\"computational complexity\"","\"continuous movement\"","\"decision tree\"","\"decision trees\"","\"Decision trees\"","\"DP\"","\"dynamic programming\"","\"Dynamic programming\"","\"Dynamic programming (DP)\"","\"game theory\"","\"Games\"","\"general road network\"","\"IIP\"","\"intruder isolation problem\"","\"intruder location\"","\"isolation problem\"","\"mobile robots\"","\"numerical analysis\"","\"numerical implementations\"","\"optimal control\"","\"Optimal control\"","\"partial information\"","\"passing intruder\"","\"pursuit evasion (PE)\"","\"Roads\"","\"Search problems\"","\"telerobotics\"","\"UAV\"","\"UGS ranking scheme\"","\"UGSs\"","\"unattended ground sensors\"","\"unmanned aerial vehicle\"","\"unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)\"","\"Unmanned aerial vehicles\""],"title":"Intruder Isolation on a General Road Network Under Partial Information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Krishnamoorthy Kalyanam","David Casbeer","Meir Pachter"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611007062,"objectID":"e36a8b577312c8f9f15d160c01c8b9fd","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/kalyanam-monotone-2017/","publishdate":"2021-01-18T21:57:42.537102Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalyanam-monotone-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Monotone Optimal Threshold Feedback Policy for Sequential Weapon Target Assignment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eloy Garcia","Yongcan Cao","David W Casbeer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611007057,"objectID":"08e3de167bccc65b9e6ae420971b9a9f","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/garcia-periodic-et-2017/","publishdate":"2021-01-18T21:57:36.93727Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-periodic-et-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Multi-agent systems' cooperation to achieve global goals is usually limited by sensing, actuation, and communication issues. At the local level, continuous measurement and actuation is only approximated by the use of digital mechanisms that measure and process information in order to compute and update new control input values at discrete time instants. Interaction with other agents takes place, in general, through a digital communication channel with limited bandwidth where transmission of continuous-time signals is not possible. This technical note considers the problem of consensus (or synchronization of state trajectories) of multi-agent systems that are described by general linear dynamics and are connected using undirected graphs. The proposed event-triggered consensus protocol not only avoids the need for continuous communication between agents but also provides a decentralized method for transmission of information in the presence of time-varying communication delays, where each agent decides its own broadcasting time instants based only on local information. This method gives more flexibility for scheduling information broadcasting compared to periodic and sampled-data implementations.","tags":["\"Broadcasting\"","\"Consensus\"","\"consensus problem\"","\"Current measurement\"","\"decentralised control\"","\"decentralized method\"","\"delays\"","\"Delays\"","\"event-triggered consensus protocol\"","\"event-triggered control\"","\"graph theory\"","\"information broadcasting\"","\"information transmission\"","\"linear dynamics\"","\"linear multiagent systems\"","\"linear systems\"","\"multi-agent system\"","\"Multi-agent systems\"","\"multi-robot systems\"","\"multiagent systems cooperation\"","\"Nickel\"","\"periodic control\"","\"periodic event-triggered synchronization\"","\"state trajectories\"","\"synchronisation\"","\"Synchronization\"","\"time-varying communication delays\"","\"time-varying systems\"","\"trajectory control\"","\"undirected graphs\""],"title":"Periodic Event-Triggered Synchronization of Linear Multi-Agent Systems With Communication Delays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaofeng Wang","Eloy Garcia","Zheqing Zhou","Derek Kingston","David Casbeer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611329636,"objectID":"f5c74fe962022a7fd2a5e583caa9fe61","permalink":"https://dcasbeer.github.io/publication/wang-projection-based-2017/","publishdate":"2021-01-22T15:33:56.348897Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-projection-based-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Projection-Based Consensus for Time-Critical Coordination of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles under Velocity Constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Satyanarayana G.

To aid the pursuer and provide feedback information, certain roads in the network have been instrumented with unattended ground sensors (UGSs) that detect evader motion. When the pursuer arrives at an instrumented node, the UGS therein informs the pursuer if and when the evader visited the node. The pursuer is aware of the bounds on the evader‚Äôs speed. Moreover, the embedded graph with the UGSs as vertices and connecting roads as edges is restricted to be a directed acyclic graph (DAG). At time $0$, the evader‚Äôs entry into the road network is registered at UGS $1$, the entry node. The pursuer also arrives at the entry node after some delay $d\u0026gt;0$ and is thus informed about the presence of the intruder/evader in the network, whereupon the chase is on. Capture entails the pursuer and evader being co-located at an UGS location. However, if the evader reaches an exit node of the graph without being captured, it is deemed to have escaped.

They also consider the constraints associated with communication delays. In this study, they consider directed graphs, and they also relax the consistency on the packet dropouts and the delays. By relaxing the consistency they allow the dropouts and delays for a packet broadcast by one agent to be different for each receiving node.

To aid the pursuer and provide feedback information, certain roads in the network have been instrumented with unattended ground sensors (UGSs) that detect the evader's motion. When the pursuer arrives at an instrumented node, the UGS therein informs the pursuer whether and when the evader visited that node. The pursuer is also made aware of the evader's speed. Moreover, the embedded graph comprised of the UGSs as vertices and connecting roads as edges is restricted to being a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The pursuer's motion is not restricted to the road network. In addition, the pursuer can choose to wait/loiter for an arbitrary time at any UGS location/node. At time 0, the evader's entry into the road network is registered at UGS 1, the entry node to the graph. The pursuer also arrives at the entry node after some delay $d$ and is thus informed about the presence of the intruder/evader in the network, whereupon the chase is on---the pursuer is tasked with capturing the evader. Capture entails the pursuer and evader being co-located at an UGS location. If this happens, the UGS is triggered, and this information is instantaneously relayed to the pursuer, thereby enabling capture. On the other hand, if the evader reaches one of the exit nodes of the graph without being captured, he is deemed to have escaped. We provide an algorithm that computes the maximum initial delay $d$ for which capture is guaranteed. The algorithm also returns the corresponding optimal pursuit policy.","tags":[],"title":"Pursuit of a Moving Target with Known Constant Speed on a Directed Acyclic Graph under Partial Information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eloy Garcia","David W.

The agents implement a simple decentralized auction scheme in order to resolve possible conflicts. This framework is extended to re-plan assignments when a sequence of tasks is disrupted by wind disturbance. Further, the effects of wind disturbance are also included in the task assignment process by assuming a fixed steady wind value.

GFTs are a natural evolution to Genetic Fuzzy Systems, in which multiple cascading fuzzy systems are optimized by genetic methods. In this problem a team of UCAV's must traverse through a battle space and counter enemy threats, utilize imperfect systems, cope with uncertainty, and successfully destroy critical targets. Enemy threats take the form of Air Interceptors (AIs), Surface to Air Missile (SAM) sites, and Electronic WARfare (EWAR) stations. Simultaneous training and tuning a multitude of Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs), with varying degrees of connectivity, is performed through the use of an optimized Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GFT presented in this study, the Learning Enhanced Tactical Handling Algorithm (LETHA), is able to create controllers with the presence of deep learning, resilience to uncertainties, and adaptability to changing scenarios. These resulting deterministic fuzzy controllers are easily understandable by operators, are of very high performance and efficiency, and are consistently capable of completing new and different missions not trained for.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic Fuzzy Trees and their Application Towards Autonomous Training and Control of a Squadron of Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Araz Hashemi","Yongcan Cao","David W.

To determine the optimal control policy, one has to solve a Markov decision problem, whose large size renders exact dynamic programming methods intractable. Therefore, a state aggregation based approximate linear programming method is used instead, to construct provably good suboptimal patrol policies. The state space is partitioned and the optimal cost-to-go or value function is restricted to be a constant over each partition. The resulting restricted system of linear inequalities embeds a family of Markov chains of lower dimension, one of which can be used to construct a lower bound on the optimal value function. In general, the construction of a lower bound requires the solution to a combinatorial problem. But the perimeter patrol problem exhibits a special structure that enables tractable linear programming formulation for the lower bound.
